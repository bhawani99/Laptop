## Laptop Price Prediction

**Welcome to the Laptop Price Prediction project!** This project aims to build a machine learning model for  predicting laptop prices based on their specifications.

**Problem Statement:**

Predct laptop's price based on product name, processor, processor generation, operating system, ram, ssd, hdd, and display size.

**Project Goals:**

* Uncover the **key factors influencing laptop pricing** through insightful data analysis.
* Develop a ** price prediction model**.

**Project Structure:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
    * **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values, erroneous data, and duplicate entries.
    * **Data Validation:** Ensure data quality and integrity.
    * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigate data distributions, relationships, and potential price predictors.
    * **Summary:** Key insights and findings of EDA
2. **Machine Learning:**
    * **Data Preprocessing:** Encode categorical features
    * **Model Building and Selection:** Experiment with various regression algorithms to find the best performers.
    * **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
    * **Model Selection:** Choose the model that balances accuracy, interpretability, and complexity.
    * **Final Model:** Train the best model on the entire dataset for future predictions.

**Key Technologies:**

* Python programming language
* Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
* Scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms
