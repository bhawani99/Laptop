Laptop Price Prediction

**Welcome to the Laptop Price Prediction project!** This project aims to build a machine-learning model and a user-friendly application for predicting laptop prices based on their specifications.

**Problem Statement:**

Predict a laptop's price considering key features like product name, processor-generation, operating system, ram, ssd, hdd, and display size.

**Project Goals:**

1. **Uncover Key Pricing Factors:** Through in-depth data analysis, identify the characteristics that significantly influence laptop pricing.
2. **Develop a Robust Prediction Model:** Build a machine learning model for accurate price predictions.
3. **Deploy a User-Friendly App:** Create a web application using Streamlit where users can easily input laptop specifications and receive price estimates.
4. **Host on Render:** Deploy the app on Render for smooth accessibility and scalability.

**Project Structure:**

1. **Data Preparation:**
    * **Data Cleaning:** Tackle missing values, erroneous entries, and duplicates.
    * **Data Validation:** Ensure data quality and integrity.
